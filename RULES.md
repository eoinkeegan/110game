## 🔒 Reneging Rules (Special Trump Cards)

The **top 4 trump cards** have a special privilege called **reneging** - they don't have to follow suit even if they could.

| Card | Rank | Can Renege When... |
|------|------|-------------------|
| 5 of Trump | 4 | Always - can never be forced out |
| Jack of Trump | 3 | Unless 5 of Trump was played |
| Joker | 2 | Unless 5 or Jack was played |
| Ace of Hearts | 1 | Unless 5, Jack, or Joker was played |

### When You Can Renege

If you have a reneging card of the lead suit (e.g., Ace of Hearts when Hearts is led), you have **three options**:

1. **Play the reneging card** - Follow suit with your special trump
2. **Play a different trump** - Trump the trick instead
3. **Play any other card** - Including non-trumps of other suits!

The key is: if your ONLY cards of the lead suit are reneging cards that can be held back, you're **not required to follow suit at all**.

### When Reneging is Blocked

A reneging card is **forced out** when a higher-ranked reneging card is played in the same trick:

**Example:** 
- Spades are trump, Clubs are led
- You have the Jack of Spades (rank 3) in your hand
- Someone plays the 5 of Spades (rank 4) on this trick
- You **must** play your Jack of Spades (it's been forced out)

### Complete Example

- Spades are trump, Hearts are led with King of Hearts
- You have: Ace of Hearts (reneging), Queen of Clubs
- **You can**: Play Ace of Hearts, play a Spade (trump), OR play Queen of Clubs
- The Ace of Hearts cannot be forced out by the King of Hearts (King is not a reneging card)

## 📊 Scoring

### Trick Points
- Each trick won = **5 points**
- 10 tricks × 5 points = 50 points available per round

### Bid Winner Scoring
- **Made the bid**: Earn your trick points normally
- **Failed the bid**: **Lose** the amount you bid (go negative if needed!)

### Top Trump Bonus
- **+5 points** to whoever played the **highest trump card** in the round
- This is typically the 5 of Trump, but could be lower if 5 wasn't dealt
- **Exception**: If the bid winner bid **85 or higher**, they forfeit this bonus

### Going Down the Hole
If you fail your bid, you "go down the hole" - your bid amount is subtracted from your score. You can go negative!

## 🏆 Winning the Game

The **first player to reach 110 points** wins!

**Tie-breaker**: If multiple players could reach 110 in the same round:
1. Points are counted trick-by-trick in order
2. First to hit 110 during trick counting wins
3. Bid winner who failed their bid cannot win that round

---

## 💡 Strategy Tips

1. **Bidding**: Don't overbid! Going down the hole hurts
2. **5 of Trump**: If you have it, you control the round
3. **Ace of Hearts**: Always valuable since it's always trump
4. **Watch for reneging**: High trumps can be saved for later
5. **Card swapping**: Ditch weak off-suit cards
6. **Count trumps**: Know how many are still out there
7. **Lead trump early**: If you won the bid, flush out opponents' trumps
